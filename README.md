# Shortcut-Master
This is a small project in C# that can be used to access your Windows start menu items faster.
All you need to do is type in the search box and your menu item will show straight away.

Next time updates I like to add

- Send the program to the tray option
- Add the shortcuts display icon
- Add an about box
- Fix any bugs
